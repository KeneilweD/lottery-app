--Challenges--
I spent about 30 minutes trying to get a url in my terminal,I had recieved different feedback using a different flask npm
I tried this one 
python -m pip install flask
then ran the code  

I spend another hour trying to display the hmtl structure on the browser
I found out that my htm file containing javascript was not great

##What I was curious about##

ternary operator - I saw  ? and : from a react code and tried to use it for fun  

random module, gives a random result from the list. It's not "truly" random like quantum randomness, but:

It's unpredictable to users

There's no pattern

No one can "cheat" it from the frontend
